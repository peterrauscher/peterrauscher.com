    <p class="title is-1">Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Peter.</p>
    <p>
      I'm a <strong>full-stack software engineer</strong> who loves building new
      stuff, especially in the cloud. In my free time, I like to stay active in
      the gym, stay up-to-date on infosec news, and contribute to open source
      projects. As a firm believer in digital freedom, almost all of the code I
      write (except where restricted by licensing) is available for use however
      you'd like. Take a look at my
      <a href="https://github.com/peterrauscher" class="link is-underlined"
        >Github</a
      >
      for some of the work I've done!
    </p>
    <p>
      I recently graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology with my B.S. in
      Computer Science and am seeking a full-time software engineering role. You
      can checkout my

      I <em>sometimes </em>
      <a class="link is-underlined" href="/blog">blog</a> about stuff that
      interests me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's mostly tech-oriented, but expect some opinion pieces here and there.
